# Ansibles.

A collection of [Ansible](http://ansible.com) roles, targeting Debian. All roles try to satisfy the single-resonsibility principle, promoting composable playbooks.

## Setup.

Create an hosts file and list all your hostnames there. Then inside host_vars create one file per hostname, following the [example](host_vars/example).

## Roles.

All available roles are documented in the [example](example.yml) playbook.

## License.
